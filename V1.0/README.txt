This github repo was originally made for my master thesis project "Building an integrated plant microbiome MAG catalogue"
A copy of my thesis is included in this git repo that contains additinal information on the tool and results that have been obtained.

This is in part a snakemake workflow.
The snakemake workflow handles the sample downloading, quality control, normalisation
